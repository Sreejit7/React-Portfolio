      "a": "I'm one of those who never coded before college and started really late.(Better late than never!) The first language I was introduced to at my college was C. Since then, I've learnt a few new languages and frameworks, and each one has added to the excitement of learning something new! I know coding can be equally fun and frustrating at times, but when it works, that gives me great inner joy! The world of programming is a never-ending ocean, and I hope to explore it a lil deeper a day."
